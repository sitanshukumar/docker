# Login to docker account first from console from where we have to push docker images
docker login 
docker login <acc_user_name>
docker login <acc_password>
Name your local images using one of these methods:

When you build them, using docker build -t <hub-user>/<repo-name>[:<tag>]
By re-tagging an existing local image docker tag <existing-image> <hub-user>/<repo-name>[:<tag>]
By using docker commit <existing-container> <hub-user>/<repo-name>[:<tag>] to commit changes
Now you can push this repository to the registry designated by its name or tag.

 docker push <hub-user>/<repo-name>:<tag>
The image is then uploaded and available for use by your teammates and/or the community.

docker login
According to the docs:

You need to include the namespace for Docker Hub to associate it with your account.
The namespace is the same as your Docker Hub account name.
You need to rename the image to YOUR_DOCKERHUB_NAME/docker-whale.
So, this means you have to tag your image before pushing:

docker tag firstimage YOUR_DOCKERHUB_NAME/firstimage
and then you should be able to push it.

docker push YOUR_DOCKERHUB_NAME/firstimage
